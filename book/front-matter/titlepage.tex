This is the unstable version of \textit{An Infinite Descent into Pure Mathematics}. Several chapters of this version are under construction, meaning that:
\begin{itemize}
\item The content in the online PDF may change significantly from one day to the next;
\item Some parts of the book contain gaps in content;
\item The organisation of material in some chapters makes little sense;
\item There are lots of notes to myself so that I remember to make changes in the future---these notes look like this:

\todo{Finish editing this textbook!}
\end{itemize}

You can find the stable version of the book at:

\textbf{Note to instructors:} If you are using this textbook to teach a class, I highly recommend that you use the stable version, or at least download an offline copy of this PDF that you can share with your students.
